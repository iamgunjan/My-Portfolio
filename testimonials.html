               <p> ‘Highly Efficient' is the phrase that comes to my mind when I think about Gunjan. I had worked with her on a project that was related to the TechDirective community (Website). She is one of the highly talented individuals in the technical field whom I have ever met. She demonstrated a deep knowledge of core concepts, designing (UI/UX), technical know-how, software field and a natural ability to share her expertise in a pleasant and comprehensible manner. She is very energetic, passionate and committed about technology. She is excellent at designing creative designs. She is also very curious and willing to learn on a constant basis. “I'm lucky to have worked with Gunjan, a Student who’s interested in the overall development as an individual !!"
